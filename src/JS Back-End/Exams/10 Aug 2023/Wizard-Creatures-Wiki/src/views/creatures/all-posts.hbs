                        Metamorphmagus. Tonks attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted
                        into Hufflepuff House. She was in the same year at Hogwarts as Gryffindor Charlie
                        Weasley. At some point, Tonks fell in love with Remus Lupin, her fellow Order member and
                        a werewolf who felt he was too poor, old, and dangerous for her and thus rejected her
                        feelings, although he felt the same way.</p>

                    <p>Description: Professor Rubeus Hagrid is an English half-giant wizard. Hagrid stood at
                        eleven feet, six inches tall. Hagrid attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and was
                        sorted into Gryffindor house. In Hagrid's third year, he was framed by Tom Riddle for
                        the crime of opening the Chamber of Secrets and using his pet Acromantula to attack
                        several Muggle-born students and eventually killing one of them. Though Hagrid's wand
                        was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as gamekeeper of Hogwarts.</p>
